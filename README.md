Option Pricing with Finite Difference and Finite Element Methods

In this project, we price European Options and Barrier Options using the Black-Scholes equation and numerical methods for PDE:
-Finite Difference Method
-Finite Element Method

We either use log-transformation or changes of variable leading to a heat equation.
